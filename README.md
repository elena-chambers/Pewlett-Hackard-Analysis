# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
At Pewlett-Hackard, there is a large population of employees that are nearing their retirement. To better prepare for personnel changes, a Retirement Titles table that holds all the titles of current employees who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955 was created using SQL. 
Additionally, employees that would be eligible to participate in a mentorship program were identifed.
